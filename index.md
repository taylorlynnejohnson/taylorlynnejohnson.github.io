## Portfolio

I am a senior mechanical engineering student at the University of Florida and a thermal sciences R&D intern at Sandia National Labs' National Solar Thermal Test Facility. My work focuses on scalable, cost-effective energy storage systems to enable rapid decarbonization. My research at NREL, Sandia's NSTTF, MIT, and UF has focused on thermal energy storage, alternative hydrogen production, and machine learning for energy sustainability:

At NREL, I focused on advancing solutions to decarbonize industrial process heat—a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. Building on NREL's ENDURING project, I developed a techno-economic analysis model in Python to optimize the sizing and cost of a CSP-PV system integrated with particle TES. Our work demonstrated the system's ability to provide solar thermal energy to the Searles Valley Mining facility, one of California's largest CO2 emitters, with an LCOE of less than 3 cents/kWhth. I presented these results at the 18th Intl Conference on Energy Sustainability in Anaheim, and ASME awarded our work the Outstanding Paper Award.

### Techno-economic analysis of a PV-CSP-TES system with sCO2 power block

My first project at the NSTTF focused on the development of a TEA model for a hybrid PV-CSP system with thermal energy storage. The model helped the startup evaluate the levelized cost of electricity of their system in different geographical locations, along with optimal component sizing and operational strategies to maximize efficiency and minimize cost. I am preparing a first author paper on this work for submission to the Journal of Solar Energy. 

### Radial Packed Bed TES design

My current work at the NSTTF focuses on the design of a radial packed bed TES system charged by photovoltaics to provide heat for a greenhouse serving the Native American Mi’kmaq tribe of Northern Maine, simulating the system’s performance under dynamic charging and discharging cycles and developing a heat loss model to optimize system components sizing. This project will be used to demonstrate the commercial potential of radial packed bed TES in decarbonizing process heat. 

### G3P3 performance-based TEA

As we approach the commissioning of the Gen 3 Partical Pilot Plant (G3P3) at the NSTTF, I will be spending the next six months on performance-based TEA modeling to help validate the system’s cost-effectiveness relative to current tower technologies.


### XCPC performance prediction

  </div>
I developed a machine learning model that integrates with a techno-economic model to predict the performance and cost of an external concentrating parabolic collector (XCPC), which I am converting to an open-source tool to support solar thermal adoption.

### Machine learning to discover novel Li-ion conductors

  </div>
Through the MICRO program, I researched the use of CGCNNs to discover novel superionic conductors at MIT's Electrochemical Energy Laboratory.

### STCH redox materials exploration

  </div>
I spent a year exploring novel metal oxides for STCH at UF’s RECL, conducting thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) tests on nonstoichiometric perovskites to study their kinetic and thermodynamic properties. This work helped identify a promising metal oxide for STCH and led to my first co-authored publication in ACS Journal of Physical Chemistry C. 

### Teaching

I hope to dedicate my life’s work to research and mentorship of the next generation of sustainability engineers, a passion I discovered through my extensive experience as a teaching assistant for classes in Solar Energy Utilization (EML6417), Heat Transfer (EML4140), Fluid Mechanics (EGN3353C), Thermodynamics (EML3100), and Computer-Aided Design (EML2023), along with a study abroad course in Spain on next-generation energy technologies taught by Drs. Aldo Steinfeld and Jonathan Scheffe, where I connected students with research opportunities and shared insights from my work.

My work is fueled by a passion rooted in the understanding that the research I conduct in the lab has the potential for tangible impacts on the lives of those most affected by global warming. I have spent the last four years working on water quantity and quality projects in Maras, Peru, as part of my university’s Engineers Without Borders team. Last year I served as the design lead for this team, leading weekly meetings to discuss project updates, collaborating with community partners and professional engineers, and guiding research and design efforts through the delegation of project tasks. Through my time on this team, I have worked on a team of student engineers to design a sluice gate and irrigation reservoir serving over 60 farmers in the region, and personally led the assessment and design phase for a project bringing running water to the region’s only medical clinic, which will be implemented in the next year. These experiences shaped my understanding of the urgent need to develop reliable and affordable renewable energy technologies and motivated my pursuit of graduate studies in this field.
